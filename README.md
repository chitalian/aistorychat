> Until ChatGPT has a better auth client solution or provides an API. I am pausing all work on this project and am working on a GPT3 alternative solution here https://github.com/chitalian/dreamsubmarine



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

You need add the following keys to your env to get this to work

```bash
export SESSION_TOKEN=<TOKEN> # see https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT on how to get session token
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<Token> # get your API key from here
```

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
